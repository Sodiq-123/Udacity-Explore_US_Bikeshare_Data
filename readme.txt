# Project Overview: Overview
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
Divvy is a bicycle sharing system in the City of Chicago and two adjacent suburbs (image: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divvy))

## Project Overview: What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:
* You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
* A text editor, like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).
* A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

# Project Details: Bike Share Data
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
In this project, you will use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

# Project Details: The Datasets
* Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
** Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
** End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
** Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
** Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
** End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
** User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
* The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
** Gender
** Birth Year
* The original files are much larger and messier, and you don't need to download them, but they can be accessed here if you'd like to see them ([Chicago](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data), [New York City](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data), [Washington](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)). These files had more columns and they differed in format in many cases. Some [data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) has been performed to condense these files to the above core six columns to make your analysis and the evaluation of your Python skills more straightforward.
